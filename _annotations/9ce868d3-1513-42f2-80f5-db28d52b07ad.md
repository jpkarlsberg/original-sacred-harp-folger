This verse was originally paired with a different hymn in the 1909 *Union Harp*, which explains any disjunct between the verse and the hymn text with which it is paired with here.  It is excerpted from the following verse of the King James Bible:
	“*Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.*”
