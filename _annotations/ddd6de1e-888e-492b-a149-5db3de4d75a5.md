The verb ?blow? is not used in the KJV (or any other Bible translation that would have been available at the time).  The verse in OSH is missing words that make the verse make sense.  It should read at least ?Blow the trumpet on the tenth...?  

Also, the verse in OSH reads ?tenth AND seventh month?, while the KJV reads ?tenth day of the seventh month?.  The King James Version reads as follows: ?*Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.*?
